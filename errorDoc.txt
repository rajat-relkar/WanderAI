1. The CrashLoopBackOff is a very common Elasticsearch issue.
    - I create a namespace logging. While deploying elasticsearch for this namespace, the pod was not running and
    its status was CrashLoopBackOff. 
    
    How I solved it?
    - In elasticsearch.yaml file, I updated the elasticsearch image
    code line in env:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.17.16
    value: "-Xms1g -Xmx1g -XX:-UseContainerSupport"

    - Elasticsearch 7.17 crashes on cgroup v2 due to a JDK container metrics bug; 
      disabling JVM container support or upgrading Elasticsearch resolves the issue.
