# WanderAI – AI Travel Itinerary Planner

WanderAI is an **AI-powered travel itinerary planning application** that generates personalized travel plans using Large Language Models (LLMs).
The application is built using **LangChain + Groq LLM**, deployed via **Docker & Kubernetes (Minikube on GCP VM)**, and monitored using a complete **ELK Stack (Filebeat, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana)**.

---

## Key Features

- AI-generated personalized travel itineraries
- Powered by **Groq LLM** via **LangChain**
- Interactive UI built with **Streamlit**
- Containerized using **Docker**
- Deployed on **Kubernetes (Minikube inside GCP VM)**
- Centralized logging and monitoring using **ELK Stack**
- Real-time log visualization in **Kibana Dashboards**
- Version-controlled using **GitHub**

## Architecture and Project Workflow

### 1. Development Phase
This phase focuses on building the core application logic.

- Project and API Setup: Initializing the project structure and configuring necessary API keys (Groq).

- Configuration Code: Setting up environmental variables and application settings.

- Itinerary Chain Code: Developing the LangChain code responsible for prompting the LLM and structuring the output.

- Travel Planner Code: Implementing the logic that orchestrates the data flow.

- Application Code using Streamlit: Building the interactive frontend application.

### 2. Containerization & Deployment
The application is prepared for a containerized deployment on Kubernetes.

- Dockerfile: Creating a file to define the Docker image for the Streamlit application.

- Kubernetes Deployment File: Defining the Kubernetes resources (Deployment, Service) for the application.

- Filebeat Deployment File: Defining the Kubernetes configuration for deploying Filebeat as a DaemonSet to collect logs.

- Logstash Deployment File: Defining the Kubernetes configuration for the Logstash service.

- Elasticsearch Deployment File: Defining the Kubernetes configuration for the Elasticsearch service.

- Kibana Deployment File: Defining the Kubernetes configuration for the Kibana service.

### 3. Version Control & Cloud Setup
Setting up the cloud environment and integrating version control.

- Code Versioning using GitHub: Committing all application and configuration files to a GitHub repository.

- GCP VM Instance Setup: Provisioning a Virtual Machine on Google Cloud Platform.

- Setup with Docker Engine, Minikube, and Kubectl: Installing all necessary tools on the VM to run the Kubernetes cluster and manage containers.

- Integrate GitHub to VM: Cloning the repository onto the GCP VM.

### 4. Build, Deploy & Monitor
The final phase involves deploying the application and setting up the monitoring system.

- Build and Deploy app on Minikube Kubernetes Cluster in VM: Using Docker to build the image and Kubectl to deploy the application and the entire ELK Stack onto the Minikube cluster.

- ELK Stack Setup with Filebeat: Configuring Filebeat to scrape logs from the application pods and forward them to Logstash, which then sends them to Elasticsearch.

- Monitoring of Logs in Kibana Dashboards: Accessing the Kibana UI to visualize and analyze the application and system logs, ensuring observability.
